PANCOBIAN  
===     

Very simple plugin that creates a scene with three.js, a sphere, and applies a 360 texture to that sphere.  
It includes the simple interactivity with the mouse.  
Includes functionality to create planes as posters.  
  
I included the repo for panolens.js just for future ideas, but it is not called in the project.  

TODO: the posters still dont get the texture.
